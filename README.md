# Splitscreen Support

Simple mod that makes it easier to position windows for local multiplayer.

With this mod installed, hitting the 'Toggle Fullscreen' button (F11) will toggle you between the following modes:

* Windowed
* Top half of screen, no border
* Bottom half...
* Left...
* Right
* Top-Left
* Top-Right
* Bottom-Left
* Bottom-Right
* Full Screen

It saves your choice and brings the window up in the same place when your restart it.  This makes it easier for
you to start two or more copies of the game and have the windows be positioned automatically for splitscreen.
